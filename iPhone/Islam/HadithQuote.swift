// A quoted narration as a REFERENCE into the app's own shelf, not a copy. The Islam tab's articles
// and the Dua screen used to carry each quoted hadith as Swift string literals, the Arabic and the
// English, and 598 of the article quotes were word-for-word what the bundled collection already
// holds. A reference cannot drift and costs nothing to ship: the words are read out of the .hpk
// the Hadith tab reads (`HadithQuoteSource`) when the quote renders, so the article shows exactly
// what the reader finds when they open the same narration on the shelf.
//
// The link names the row the way the reminder pack does: "bukhari:6306", "muslim:1163a" (the
// collection's slug and its sunnah.com citation). Word ranges are 0-based inclusive ranges of the
// row's whitespace tokens, the Arabic's counted with its chain of narrators, the English's over the
// translation alone: `arabic: 22...58` is the matn, `english: 4...61` the quoted sentence. The
// citation the reader sees is carried as written ("Sahih al-Bukhari 6306, Sahih Muslim 2705").
